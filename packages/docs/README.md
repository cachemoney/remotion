# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

Go to the root directory of the repository (`cd ../..` if you are in the `docs` directory) and run

```console
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

## Local Development

In this directory (`packages/docs`), run:

```console
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
