Creates an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function in your AWS account that will be able to render a video in the cloud.

If a function with the same version, memory size and timeout already existed, it will be returned instead without a new one being created. This means this function can be treated as idempotent.

## Example

```ts twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @target: es2017

import { deployFunction } from "@remotion/lambda";

const { functionName } = await deployFunction({
  region: "us-east-1",
  timeoutInSeconds: 120,
  memorySizeInMb: 2048,
  createCloudWatchLogGroup: true,
  architecture: "arm64",
  diskSizeInMb: 2048,
});
console.log(functionName);
```

## Arguments

An object with the following properties:

### `region`

The [AWS region](/docs/lambda/region-selection) which you want to deploy the Lambda function too. It must be the same region that your Lambda Layer resides in.

### `timeoutInSeconds`

How long the Lambda function may run before it gets killed. Must be below 900 seconds.
We recommend a timeout of 120 seconds or lower - remember, Remotion Lambda is the fastest if you render with a high concurrency. If your video takes longer to render, the concurrency should be increased rather than the timeout.

### `memorySizeInMb`

How many megabytes of RAM the Lambda function should have. By default we recommend a value of 2048MB. You may increase or decrease it depending on how memory-consuming your video is. The minimum allowed number is `512`, the maximum allowed number is `10240`. Since the costs of Remotion Lambda is directly proportional to the amount of RAM, we recommend to keep this amount as low as possible.

### `architecture`

_string_

Either `x86_64` or `arm64`. Default: `arm64`

### `createCloudWatchLogGroup`

_boolean_

Whether logs should be saved into CloudWatch. We recommend enabling this option.

### `cloudWatchLogRetentionPeriodInDays`

_optional_

Retention period for the CloudWatch Logs. Default: 14 days.

### `diskSizeInMb`

_optional_

Sets the amount of disk storage that is available in the Lambda function. Must be between 512MB and 10240MB (10GB). Default: 2048MB. Set this higher if you want to render longer videos. See also: [Disk size](/docs/lambda/disk-size)

### `customRoleArn`

_optional_

Use a custom role for the function instead of the default (`arn:aws:iam::[aws-account-id]:role/remotion-lambda-role`)

## Return value

An object with the following values:

- `functionName` (_string_): The name of the function just created.
- `alreadyExisted`: (_boolean_): Whether the creation was skipped because the function already existed.
