_Available in v3.2.23_

By calling `prefetch()`, an asset will be fetched and kept in memory so it is ready when you want to play it in a [`<Player>`](/docs/player).

If you pass the original URL into either an [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio), [`<Video>`](/docs/video), [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) or [`<Img>`](/docs/img) tag and the asset is fully fetched, those components will use Blob URL instead.

:::note
Remote assets need to support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

```tsx twoslash
import { prefetch } from "remotion";

const { free, waitUntilDone } = prefetch("https://example.com/video.mp4", {
  method: "blob-url",
});

waitUntilDone().then(() => {
  console.log("Video has finished loading");
});

// Call free() if you want to un-prefetch and free up the memory:
free();
```

This API is only useful if you are using the [`<Player />`](/docs/player) component and you want to display a media asset and want to be sure it is fully loaded before it appears.

An alternative to `prefetch()` are the [`@remotion/preload`](/docs/preload) APIs. See [`@remotion/preload` vs `prefetch()`](/docs/player/preloading#remotionpreload-vs-prefetch) to decide which one is better for your usecase.

## API

## Arguments

### `src`

The function takes a `src`, which can be a remote URL, an imported asset or an asset loaded using [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile) (see: [Importing assets](/docs/assets)). Once called, prefetching starts and an object with two properties are returned:

### `options`

#### `method` <AvailableFrom v="3.2.35" />

_previously defaulted to `blob-url`_

Either `blob-url` or `base64`.

- With `blob-url`, the asset is turned into a Blob URL using [`URL.createObjectURL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL)
- With `base64`, the asset is turned into a Base 64 URL.

Read below for which option is suitable for you.

## Return value

An object with:

- `free()` will abort the prefetching and free up the memory. Components using the asset might re-request the asset.
- `waitUntilDone()` will return a promise if called that resolves once asset has finished downloading and is ready to be using in [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio), [`<Video>`](/docs/video), [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) or [`<Img>`](/docs/img).

## `blob-url` or `base64`?

Turning the asset into a blob URL is much faster and efficient in general.  
In Safari, even though it is a local URL, Safari may not be instantly playing the audio and have slight delays buffering audio.

Use `base64` in Safari if you notice that your audio file plays with hickups even though the `<Player>` requests a `blob:` URL.
