The following error:

```bash
A delayRender() was called but not cleared after 28000ms. See https://remotion.dev/docs/timeout for help. The delayRender was called
```

generally happens if a [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) handle has been created and not been cleared afterwards. Remotion will wait to make a screenshot, but aborts it by default after 30 seconds to not hang forever.

## Possible causes

### `continueRender()` was not called

Your code might have a problem where you call [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) but never clear it. This will cause Remotion to wait forever before it starts rendering and leads to a timeout message.

**Resolution**: Check your code and make sure you are calling [`continueRender()`](/docs/continue-render).

### No internet connection or firewall issue

If you rely on network assets such as fonts, images, videos or audio and you don't have internet connection or requests get blocked by a firewall. Special attention has to be given to when you are rendering in the cloud, Amazon VPC could for example block outgoing network requests and lead to a timeout.

**Resolution**: Make sure all network resources you require can be accessed.

### Importing MP4 videos in Chromium

Chrome has the codecs needed for displaying MP4 videos, but Chromium doesn't. If you try to load an MP4 video or an unsupported audio codec in Chromium, it currently leads to a timeout.

:::warning
On Linux, if no version of Chrome is installed, one will be downloaded that does not contain codecs for MP3 or MP4. We will address this in a future version of Remotion.
:::

**Workaround**: Convert videos to WebM or use Chrome instead of Chromium.

### Memory pressure

When setting the concurrency too high, Chrome might decide to not load some `<Video />`s which can lead to a timeout error.

We consider this a bug in Remotion and plan to fix it in the future.

**Workaround**: Reduce the `concurrency` to a level where Chrome can load all videos.

### Old version of Remotion

Older versions of Remotion had bugs which could lead to timeout.
Especially 1.x releases could timeout when importing large assets

**Resolution**: Upgrade to the latest Remotion version using `npm run upgrade`.

## Increase timeout

Sometimes, you cannot avoid a render taking longer than 30 seconds. For example:

- Expensive WebGL scenes
- Expensive preprocessing of data

You can increase the default timeout from v2.6.3 on:

- Using the [`--timeout`](/docs/cli/render#--timeout) CLI flag
- Using the `timeoutInMilliseconds` option in [`renderStill()`](/docs/renderer/render-still#timeoutinmilliseconds), [`renderFrames()`](/docs/renderer/render-frames#timeoutinmilliseconds), [`getCompositions()`](/docs/renderer/get-compositions#timeoutinmilliseconds), [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media#timeoutinmilliseconds), [`renderMediaOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda#timeoutinmilliseconds) and [`renderStillOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/renderstillonlambda#timeoutinmilliseconds)
- Using the [`Config.setDelayRenderTimeoutInMilliseconds()`](/docs/config#setdelayrendertimeoutinmilliseconds) option in the config file

## Adding a label to help debugging

_Available from v2.6.13_

If you encounter a timeout and don't know where it came from, you can add a label as a parameter:

```tsx twoslash
import { delayRender } from "remotion";

// ---cut---

delayRender("Fetching data from API...");
```

If the call times out, the label will be referenced in the error message:

```
Uncaught Error: A delayRender() "Fetching data from API..." was called but not cleared after 28000ms. See https://remotion.dev/docs/timeout for help. The delayRender was called
```
